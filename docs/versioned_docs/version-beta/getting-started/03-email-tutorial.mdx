Aside from authenticating users in NextAuth.js via [OAuth](/getting-started/oauth-tutorial), you can also enable the option to authenticate them via "magic links". These are links that are sent to the user's email and when clicking on them they'll sign up the user automatically.

Adding support for signing in via email in addition to one or more OAuth services provides a way for users to sign in if they lose access to their OAuth account (e.g. if it is locked or deleted).

The Email provider can be used in conjunction with (or instead of) one or more OAuth providers.

## How it works

On initial sign in, a **Verification Token** is sent to the email address provided. By default this token **is valid for 24 hours**. If the Verification Token is used within that time (i.e. by clicking on the link in the email) an account is created for the user and they are signed in.

:::tip
The Email Provider can be used with both JSON Web Tokens and database sessions, but you [must configure a database adapter](/guides/adapters/setting-up-a-database-adapter) to use it. It is not possible to enable email sign in without using a database.
:::

## 1. Installing `nodemailer`

[`nodemailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) is a [peer dependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) when using the Email Provider. This means we need to install before we can start sending emails:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install -D nodemailer
```

`nodemailer` will enable us to send emails from NodeJS, which the runtime on which NextJS application operate.

## 2. Setting up a SMTP service

Next we need a [SMTP service](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) which will be in charge of sending emails from our application. There's a number of services available for this, however [here are the ones](http://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/) known to work with `nodemailer`.

:::info
For this tutorial, we're gonna be using [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/), but any of the services linked above should work the same
:::

First create an account in and then login to the dashboard, then navigate to "Settings â†’ API Keys" and create an API key:

<img src={smtpConfig} />

Next paste the API in your terminal as so, and run the command:
```bash
echo -n '<YOUR_API_KEY>' | openssl base64
```

Next, as [per Sendgrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/integrating-with-the-smtp-api), let's add the following [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) in our NextJS app:

```bash title=".env.local"
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD={API_KEY}
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PROT=587
EMAIL_FROM={SENDER_EMAIL}
```

Note that we're also specifying from which domain email are going to be sent from. You're gonna need to verify [a sender identity](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity) so that Sendgrid can send emails from your domain.

Nice! We're getting there. Now we need to read supply this values as the configuration for our Email Provider. Open `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` and do the following:

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import EmailProvider from "next-auth/providers/email"

export default NextAuth({
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
  providers: [
    Email({
      server: {
        host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT),
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
        }
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
    }),
  ],
})
```

## 3. Setting up an adapter

Finally, we'll need to set up a database adapter to store verification tokens the Email Provider will emit when verifying users.

An **Adapter** in NextAuth.js connects your application to whatever database or backend system you want to use to store data for users, their accounts, sessions, etc...

For this tutorial, we're going to use the **MongoDB** adapter, other any of the other adapters will work just fine.

First, let's start by installing the adapter package:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install -D  @next-auth/mongodb-adapter mongodb
```

and create a simple MongoDB client:

```ts title="lib/mongodb/client.ts"
// This approach is taken from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb"

const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI
const options = {
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  useNewUrlParser: true,
}

let client
let clientPromise

if (!process.env.MONGODB_URI) {
  throw new Error("Please add your Mongo URI to .env.local")
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  // In development mode, use a global variable so that the value
  // is preserved across module reloads caused by HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
  if (!global._mongoClientPromise) {
    client = new MongoClient(uri, options)
    global._mongoClientPromise = client.connect()
  }
  clientPromise = global._mongoClientPromise
} else {
  // In production mode, it's best to not use a global variable.
  client = new MongoClient(uri, options)
  clientPromise = client.connect()
}

// Export a module-scoped MongoClient promise. By doing this in a
// separate module, the client can be shared across functions.
export default clientPromise
```
And now let's reference this new adapter from our NextAuth.js configuration file:

```diff title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import EmailProvider from "next-auth/providers/email"
+ import { MongoDBAdapter } from "@next-auth/mongodb-adapter"
+ import clientPromise from "../../../lib/mongodb/client"

export default NextAuth({
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
  providers: [
+   adapter: MongoDBAdapter(clientPromise),
    EmailProvider({
      server: {
        host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
        port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
        }
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
    }),
  ],
})
```

## 4. Wiring all together

Now that everything is properly configured, let's try to sign in via email on our application.

...

:::info
A user account (i.e. an entry in the Users table) will not be created for the user until the first time they verify their email address. If an email address is already associated with an account, the user will be signed in to that account when they use the link in the email.
