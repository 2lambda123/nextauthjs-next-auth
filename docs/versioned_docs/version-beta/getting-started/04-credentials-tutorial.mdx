title: Credentials authentication
---

NextAuth.js is built in a way that is flexible to integrate it with any authentication back-end you or your company may already have.

This library has been designed to handle the user session client wise, in a flexible way to support multiple authentication methods (OAuth, Email, etc...) in a way that you're not forced to build an authentication back-end.

For this tutorial, we're going to use [NextAuth.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example) as a base.

## 1. Creating an authentication back-end

To keep it simple, we're going to use [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started) to quickly build an API that will accept requests on `POST /users/login` and will return always a `200` response with the following shape:
```json
{
  "id": "12345-abc",
  "token": "E5PWX4T9dcPriIo..."
}
```
:::note
Remember, we're doing this to simulate how you would integrate with an existing API with authentication, but it's not needed when using the **CredentialsProvider**!
:::

Let's start by installing `json-server`:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install -D json-server
```

and create the following `db.json` file at the root of our project:

```json
{
  "users": {
    "login": {
      "id": "12345-abc",
      "token": "E5PWX4T9dcPriIo..."
    }
  }
}
```
