title: Credentials authentication
---

NextAuth.js is built in a way that is flexible to integrate it with any authentication back-end you or your company may already have.

This library has been designed to handle the user session client wise, in a flexible way to support multiple authentication methods (OAuth, Email, etc...) in a way that you're not forced to build an authentication back-end.

The Credentials Provider is simple and flexible at the same time. It'll just forward the credentials (username/password) inserted by the user in the login form and let us in charge to validate those against the API or whatever mechanism we're authenticating against.

For this tutorial, we're going to use [NextAuth.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example) as a base.

## 2. Credentials Provider set up

Now let's set up the Credentials Provider in our NextAuth.js initialization:

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials"

export default NextAuth({

  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      async authorize(credentials) {
        const authResult = await fetch('/users/login', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            email: credentials.email,
            password:
          })
        })
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```
