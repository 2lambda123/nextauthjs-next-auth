# Magic links with Forward Email

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up Auth.js in a Next.js application to be able to log in with **Forward Email**.

Magic links (also known as "passwordless") authentication is a login method which uses emails containing a verification token embedded in a URL. When the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to your Auth.js app and be logged in, as long as that verification token is still valid.

<Callout type="info">
  This tutorial uses Forward Email as the Passwordless email provider and
  Next.js as the framework. Note that for any OAuth provider or any framework,
  **the process will be the same/very similar**, mainly differing on how you
  register your application in the chosen provider's dashboard.

## Setting up Auth.js

### Installing Auth.js and Next.js

For this tutorial, we're gonna use the default [Auth.js & Next.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example). If you already have an existing Next.js app, it should work too. If you don't, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git && cd next-auth-example
```

If you're using the example app, Auth.js is already installed, otherwise follow the [installation instructions](/getting-started/installation).

### Creating the server config

Next, we're gonna create the main Auth.js configuration file which contains the necessary configuration for Auth.js, as well as the dynamic route handler.

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import ForwardEmail from "next-auth/providers/forwardemail"

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [ForwardEmail],
})
```

```ts filename="app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"
export { GET, POST } from "@/auth"
```

Since this is a [catch-all dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments), it will respond to all the relevant Auth.js API routes so that your application can interact with the chosen OAuth provider using the [OAuth 2](https://oauth.net/2) protocol.

### Adding environment variables

If you haven't, create an `.env.local` file as explained in the [installation section](/getting-started/installation) and add the following Forward Email API key variable.

```bash filename=".env.local" {3}
AUTH_SECRET="changeMe"

AUTH_FORWARDEMAIL_KEY=
```

We will be filling `AUTH_FORWARDEMAIL_KEY` with a proper key from Forward Email's My Account &rarr; Security page once we've registered our account and application (domain name).

## Registering your App

To be able to send Emails using Forward Email you'll need to do two things.

1. Create an API Key
2. Verify your Domain

### API Key

You'll need to sign up for an account at [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net), and then go to ["My Account &rarr; Security"](https://forwardemail.net/my-account/security) in the navigation drop-down. There you can create, copy, and generate new API keys.

### Domain

To verify your domain, follow the Forward Email instructions at ["My Account &rarr; Domains &rarr; Setup"](https://forwardemail.net/my-account/domains) and come back once you've got everything set up with your domain.

Next, you will have to update the `from` address to be from the domain you've configured and verified in Forward Email.

```ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import ForwardEmail from "next-auth/providers/forwardemail"

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    ForwardEmail({
      from: "auth@app.company.com",
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Wiring all together

Now that we have the required API key, paste it into your `.env.local` file we created earlier.

```bash filename=".env.local" {3}
AUTH_SECRET="changeMe"

AUTH_FORWARDEMAIL_KEY={apiKey}
```

With all the pieces in place, you can now start your local dev server and test the login process.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see the following page:

import AppStart from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/app-start.webp"

<Screenshot src={AppStart} alt="App Start" />

Click on **"Sign in"**, you should be redirected to the default Auth.js signin page. You can [customize this page](/guides/pages/signin) to fit your needs. Next, enter your email address in the email input field and click **"Sign in with Forward Email"**.

Go to your email inbox and you should find the email from your Auth.js application with a button labelled "Sign in". Click on this button and you should be redirected back to your local dev app and be signed in!

import GitHubAuthSuccess from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-success.webp"

<Screenshot src={GitHubAuthSuccess} alt="GitHub Authentication Success" />

If you've landed back here that means everything worked! We have completed the whole passwordless authentication flow so that your users can log in to your application via passwordless magic-links!

  You can customize the contents of this email and modify some additional
  Forward Email parameters. For more details, check out our [Forward Email
  provider](/getting-started/providers/forwardemail) docs page.

## Deployment

Deploying your Auth.js application with Forward Email does not require any other changes. Just make sure you've added all the required environment variables to your production environment. Refer to the [Deployment page](/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
