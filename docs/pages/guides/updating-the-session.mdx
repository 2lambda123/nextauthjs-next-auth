# Updating the Session

Auth.js libraries provide a way to update the session with additional information received from a user.

## With JWT

<Callout type="warning">
  Although it is possible to update a JWT session, due to its stateless nature, the updated information will be lost on the next login.
  To persist the updated information across logins, use a database session, or ask the user to update their information in the provider directly,
  and then log in again in your app
</Callout>

To have access to the user id, add the following to your Auth.js configuration:

```ts
  callbacks: {
    jwt({ token, user }) {
      return token
    },
    session({ session, token }) {
      return session
    },
  },
```

## With Database


```ts
  callbacks: {
    session({ session, user }) {
      return session
    },
  },
```
