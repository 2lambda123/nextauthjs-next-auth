## Environment Variables

<Callout>
  For consistency, we recommend prefixing all Auth.js environment variables with
  `AUTH_`. This way we can better autodetect them, and they can also be
  distinguished from other environment variables more easily.
</Callout>

Auth.js libraries require you to set an `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable. This is used to encrypt cookies and tokens. It should be a random string of at least 32 characters. On Unix based systems you can use this command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm exec auth secret
```

Alternatively, you can use the following `openssl` command, which should be available on all Linux / Mac OS X systems.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 33
```

If you are using an [OAuth Provider](/reference/oauth-providers), your provider will have a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that you will need to set as environment variables as well (in the case of an OIDC provider, like Auth0, a third `issuer` value might be also required, refer to the provider's setup documentation).

<Callout type="info">
Auth.js supports **environment variable inference**, meaning that if you name your provider environment variables following a specific syntax, you won't need to explicitly pass them to the providers in your configuration.

Client ID's and client secrets should be named `AUTH_[PROVIDER]_ID` and `AUTH_[PROVIDER]_SECRET`. If your provider requires an issuer, that should be named `AUTH_[PROVIDER]_ISSUER`. For example:

```bash
AUTH_OKTA_ID=abc
AUTH_OKTA_SECRET=abc
AUTH_OKTA_ISSUER=abc
```

</Callout>

### `AUTH_SECRET`

This is the only strictly required environment variable. It is the secret used to encode the JWT and encrypt things in transit. As mentioned above, we recommend at least a 32 character random string. This can be generated via the CLI with `npm exec auth secret` or via openssl with `openssl rand -base64 33`.

### `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`

When deploying your application behind a reverse proxy, you'll need to set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` equal
to `true`. This tells Auth.js to trust the `X-Forwarded-Host` header from the reverse proxy. Auth.js will automatically infer this to be true if we detect the environment variable indicating that your application is running on one of the supported hosting providers. Currently `VERCEL` and `CF_PAGES` (Cloudflare Pages) are supported.

### `AUTH_URL`

This environment variable is mostly unnecessary with v5 as the host is inferred from the request headers. However, if you are using a different base path, you can set this environment variable as well. For example, `AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/web/auth` or `AUTH_URL=https://company.com/app1/auth`

### `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL`

This environment variable is designed for advanced use-cases only, when using Auth.js as a proxy for preview deploys, for example. For more details, see the [securign preview deploys](#securing-a-preview-deployment) section below.

## Serverless

Hosting services like Vercel and Netlify are great for deploying apps with Auth.js authentication. The following steps should help you get started:

1. Create the required [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your desired environments. Don't forget to also add the required environment variables for your provider of choice (i.e. OAuth clientId / secret, etc.).
2. When using an OAuth provider, make sure the callback URL for your production URL is setup correctly. Many OAuth providers will only allow you to set 1 callbackUrl per OAuth application. In which case, you'll need to create separate applications for each environment (development, production, etc.). Other providers, like Google, allow you to add many callbackUrls.
   - By default, the callbackUrl for `next-auth` (Next.js) applications should look something like this: `https://company.com/api/auth/callback/[provider]` (replace `company.com` with your domain and `provider` with the provider name, i.e. `github`).
   - All other frameworks (`@auth/sveltekit`, `@auth/express`, etc.) by default will use the path `/auth/callback/[provider]`.
3. Deploy! After having setup those two prerequisites, you should be able to deploy and run your Auth.js application in production!

## Self-hosted

Auth.js can also be deployed anywhere you can deploy the framework of your choice. Check out the framework's documentation on self-hosting.

### Docker

When using Auth.js in a Docker environment, make sure to set either `trustHost: true` in your Auth.js configuration or the `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` environment variable to `true`. Below is an example `Dockerfile` and matching `docker-compose.yml` for a Next.js application running Auth.js.

## Securing a preview deployment

Most OAuth providers cannot be configured with multiple callback URLs or using a wildcard.

However, Auth.js **supports Preview deployments**, even **with OAuth providers**:

1. Determine a stable deployment URL. Eg.: A deployment whose URL does not change between builds, for example. `auth.yourdomain.com` (using a subdomain is not a requirement, this can be the main site's URL too, for example.)
2. Set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to that stable deployment URL, including the path from where Auth.js handles the routes. Eg.: (`https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth`)
3. For your OAuth provider, set the callback URL using the stable deployment URL. Eg.: For GitHub `https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/github`)

Fun fact: all of our example apps mentioned above are using the proxy functionality!

<Callout type="info">
  To support preview deployments, the `AUTH_SECRET` value needs to be the same
  for the stable deployment and deployments that will need OAuth support.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are storing users in a [database](/reference/core/adapters), we
  recommend using a different OAuth app for development/production so that you
  don't mix your test and production user base.
</Callout>

<details>
<summary>
<b>How does this work?</b>
</summary>
To support preview deployments, Auth.js requires a deployment URL that is stable across deploys as a redirect proxy server.

It will redirect the OAuth callback request to the preview deployment URL, but only when the `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` environment variable is set.

When a user initiates an OAuth sign-in flow on a preview deployment, we save its URL in the `state` query parameter but set the `redirect_uri` to the stable deployment.

Then, the OAuth provider will redirect the user to the stable URL mentioned above, which will verify the `state` parameter and redirect the user to the preview deployment URL if the `state` is valid. This is secured by relying on the same server-side `AUTH_SECRET` for the stable deployment and the preview deployment.
