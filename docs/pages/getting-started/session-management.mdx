# Managing the user session

Auth.js ships with lightweight utilities to help you manage the user's session easily. Aside from built-in pages, which are themable or [fully customisable](/guides/pages/signin), Auth.js does not come with any built-in styles.

You're in charge of the building the UI for session management. In the following pages we summarise some of the most common patterns for handling user sessions that you'll need to build before shipping your app to production.

1. [Signin and Signout](/getting-started/session-management/login) - Using the functions to execute signin and signout actions
2. [Get Session](/getting-started/session-management/get-session) - Accessing the session in various environments
3. [Protecting Resources](/getting-started/session-management/protecting) - Gating resources based on the user's session
4. [Custom Pages](/getting-started/session-management/custom-pages) - Building custom authentication pages
