### Nodemailer Setup

To setup "magic links" (sign in tokens sent to the user's email), we will need to use one of the built-in Email Providers - Resend, Sendgrid or Nodemailer.

To sign in, a user provides their email address, then a **Verification Token** is sent to the them. By default this token is valid <u>for 24 hours</u>. If the Verification Token is used within that time (i.e. by clicking on the link in the email) an account is created for the user and they are signed in.

<Callout>
  Magic links are setup through the Email Providers. An Email Provider can be
  used with both [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) and [database
  sessions](/concepts/session-strategies#database-session), but you **must
  configure a database to use it**. It is not possible to enable email sign in
  without using a database.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Install `nodemailer`

Auth.js does not include `nodemailer` as a dependency, so you'll need to install it yourself if you want to use an Email Provider. Run:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install nodemailer
```

You will need access to an SMTP server, ideally from one of [the services known to work with nodemailer](https://community.nodemailer.com/2-0-0-beta/setup-smtp/well-known-services/).

### Database Adapter

Please make sure you've [setup a database adapter](/docs/database), as mentioned earlier,
a database is required for passwordless login to work as verification tokens need to be stored.

### Connecting to the SMTP server

There are two ways to configure the SMTP server connection: using a connection string or a configuration object.

  <Tabs.Tab>

```bash filename=".env"
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://username:password@smtp.example.com:587
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@example.com
```

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import Nodemailer from "next-auth/providers/nodemailer";

providers: [
  Nodemailer({
    server: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER,
    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
  }),
],
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```bash filename=".env"
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=username
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=password
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@example.com
```

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import Nodemailer from "next-auth/providers/nodemailer";
...
providers: [
  Nodemailer({
    server: {
      host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
      port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
      auth: {
        user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
        pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
      }
    },
    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
  }),
],
```

  and feel of the emails the user receives to sign in.
</Callout>

### Signin Button

Next, we can add a sign in button somewhere in your application like the Navbar. This will forward the user on to the Auth.js default signin page.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="./components/sign-in.tsx"
import { signIn } from "../../auth.ts"

export function SignIn() {
  return (
    <form
      action={async () => {
        "use server"
        await signIn()
      }}
    >
      <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

### Signin

Start your application, click on the sign in button we just added, and you should see Auth.js [built-in sign in page](/tutorials/custom-pages/built-in-pages) with the option to sign in with your email:

<Screenshot src={MagicLink} alt="Screenshot of sign in page" />

Insert your email and click "Sign in with Email". You should receive an email from Auth.js, click on it and should be redirected to your application, landing already authenticated.

</Steps>
