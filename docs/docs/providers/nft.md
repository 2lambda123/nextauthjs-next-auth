With the NFT provider users of your application can be their own identity provider, by using NFTs as method of authentication.
The validation happens on the server and is handled by the IDP Kit of walt.id, an open-source product.
It can be configured to only check if a user holds an NFT of a specified collection or if the NFT also holds certain traits 
in order to be logged in successfully.
