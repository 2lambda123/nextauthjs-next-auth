title: Upgrade Guide (v5)
---

Auth.js version 5 includes a few breaking changes from the last major version (4.x). So we're here to help you upgrade your applications as smoothly as possible. It should be possible to upgrade from any version of 4.x to the latest 5 release by following the next few migration steps.

You can upgrade to the new version by running:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install next-auth
```


## Summary

We hope this migration goes smoothly for each and every one of you! If you have any questions or get stuck anywhere, feel free to create [a new issue](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/new) on GitHub.
