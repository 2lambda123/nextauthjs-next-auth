## About Auth.js

Auth.js is a complete open-source authentication solution for web applications. It was designed for Next.js but has gone framework-agnostic and can work with any JavaScript framework or library. Check out the live demos of Auth.js in action:

- [Next.js](https://next-auth-example.vercel.app/)
- [SvelteKit](https://sveltekit-auth-example.vercel.app/)
- [SolidStart](https://auth-solid.vercel.app/)

Continue to our tutorials to see how easy it is to use Auth.js for authentication:

- [Setup with OAuth](/getting-started/oauth-tutorial)
- [Setup with magic links](/getting-started/email-tutorial)
- [Integrating with external auth](/getting-started/credentials-tutorial)

### Flexible and easy to use

- Designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports OAuth 1.0, 1.0A, 2.0, and OpenID Connect
- Built-in support for [many popular sign-in services](/reference/providers/oauth-builtin)
- Supports [email / passwordless authentication](/getting-started/email-tutorial)
- Supports stateless authentication with [any backend](/getting-started/credentials-tutorial) (Active Directory, LDAP, etc)
- Supports both JSON Web Tokens and database sessions
- Designed for Serverless but runs anywhere (AWS Lambda, Docker, Heroku, etc.)
- Runtime-agnostic, run on Node.js, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, etc.

### Own your data

Auth.js can work with or without a database.

- An open-source solution that allows you to keep control of your data
- Supports Bring Your Own Database (BYOD) and can be used with any database
- Built-in support for [MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, SQL Server, MongoDB, and SQLite](/getting-started/databases)
- Works great with databases from popular hosting providers
- Can also be used _without a database_ (e.g. OAuth + JWT)

_Note: Email sign-in requires a database to store single-use verification tokens._

### Secure by default

- Promotes the use of passwordless sign-in mechanisms
- Designed to be secure by default and encourage best practices for safeguarding user data
- Uses Cross-Site Request Forgery Tokens on POST routes (sign in, sign out)
- Default cookie policy aims for the most restrictive policy appropriate for each cookie
- When JSON Web Tokens are enabled, they are encrypted by default (JWE) with A256GCM
- Auto-generates symmetric signing and encryption keys for developer convenience
- Features tab/window syncing and keepalive messages to support short-lived sessions
- Attempts to implement the latest guidance published by [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)

Advanced options allow you to define your routines to handle what accounts are allowed to sign in, for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens, and to set custom cookie security policies and session properties, so you can control who can sign in and how often sessions have to be re-validated.
